Todo.

* File caching.
  - Create temporary files in /tmp upon open(), rm upon close().
  - Maintain a list of tempfiles.
  - Check SHA-1 or MD5s to see if changes need to be propagated.

* Implement read-write capabilities.

* Fake Unixy directories, study how categories really work.

* Mangle names to avoid collisions in the filesystem.

* Decide if Google's API works or if I have to (or want to) roll my own.

* Check if a normal user has rights to create new files -- otherwise the 
  project is slightly pointless.
